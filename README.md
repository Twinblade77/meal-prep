This is my odin-project recipe website project.

This is an HTML project for The Odin Project Foundations course. 
The purpose of this project is to build a functional multi page website that displays recipes using HTML.
The website consist of a main index page that links to individual recipe pages. Each subsequent recipe page includes an image, a small description, an ingredients list, and cooking instructions.

Used elements like <a>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <h1>â€“<h6>, and <p>.
Practiced creating internal links between multiple HTML files.
Improved my understanding of semantic HTML and document structure.
Gained experience organizing files and folders in a basic web project.
